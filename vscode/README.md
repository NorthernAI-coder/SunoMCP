# Suno MCP

AI music generation with Suno — songs, lyrics, covers, stems, and more.

[![VS Code Marketplace](https://img.shields.io/visual-studio-marketplace/v/acedatacloud.mcp-suno?label=VS%20Code)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=acedatacloud.mcp-suno) [![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/mcp-suno.svg?label=PyPI)](https://pypi.org/project/mcp-suno/) [![Hosted MCP](https://img.shields.io/badge/hosted-mcp-blue)](https://suno.mcp.acedata.cloud/mcp)

Connect VS Code's AI agents to Suno through Ace Data Cloud. Generate songs from text prompts, write custom lyrics with full musical control, extend tracks, remix or cover, separate stems, export MP4/WAV/MIDI — all from chat.

This extension registers the **suno** MCP server with VS Code so GitHub
Copilot and any other agent that speaks the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/)
can call it directly from chat.

---

## Quick Start

1. **Install this extension.** VS Code registers the `suno` MCP server automatically.
2. **Get an API key** from [Ace Data Cloud](https://platform.acedata.cloud/console/applications) (Applications → API Key). New accounts include free trial credit.
3. **Open Copilot Chat** in agent mode and ask for a music task — the extension prompts for the API key the first time and stores it in the OS keychain via VS Code's `SecretStorage`.

You can rotate or remove the API key any time from the command palette:

- **Suno MCP: Set Ace Data Cloud API Key**
- **Suno MCP: Clear Ace Data Cloud API Key**

> The default config talks to the **hosted streamable-HTTP endpoint** at
> `https://suno.mcp.acedata.cloud/mcp` — no Python, no `uvx`, no local install needed.

## VS Code Setup Guide

For screenshots, token setup, project-level and user-level `mcp.json`, and Copilot Agent Mode examples, see:

- [Suno MCP VS Code guide](https://platform.acedata.cloud/documents/promotion_article_mcp_suno_vscode)
- [All Ace Data Cloud MCP servers in VS Code](https://platform.acedata.cloud/documents/promotion_article_mcp_all_vscode)

### Example prompts

- "Generate a lofi hip-hop track about late-night coding. Use suno."
- "Write lyrics for a punk song about deadline pressure, then turn them into a song."
- "Cover the song with task id <id> in a jazz piano style."

## Configuration

This extension implements the `mcpServerDefinitionProviders` contribution point
and registers a single hosted server with VS Code:

```text
Provider id : acedatacloud.suno
Server label: Suno MCP
Server URL  : https://suno.mcp.acedata.cloud/mcp
Transport   : Streamable HTTP
Auth        : Bearer API key from VS Code SecretStorage (or $ACEDATACLOUD_API_TOKEN)
```

You don't need to edit `mcp.json` — the extension handles registration and
token handling automatically. If you'd rather configure things by hand, the
sections below show equivalent `mcp.json` snippets you can use **instead of**
this extension.

### Alternative: manual `mcp.json` (hosted)

```jsonc
{
  "servers": {
    "suno": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://suno.mcp.acedata.cloud/mcp",
      "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer ${input:acedatacloud_api_token}" }
    }
  },
  "inputs": [
    {
      "type": "promptString",
      "id": "acedatacloud_api_token",
      "description": "Ace Data Cloud API key",
      "password": true
    }
  ]
}
```

### Alternative: local stdio (no network roundtrip)

For offline dev, air-gapped environments, or pinning to a specific PyPI
version, install [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) and use:

```jsonc
{
  "servers": {
    "suno": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["mcp-suno"],
      "env": { "ACEDATACLOUD_API_TOKEN": "${input:acedatacloud_api_token}" }
    }
  }
}
```

`uvx` will download and run the latest [`mcp-suno`](https://pypi.org/project/mcp-suno/) on demand.
